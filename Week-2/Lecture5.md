# Linux Process Management

* Helps to switch between tasks while we are in the command line environment.

## ` sleep `

* Delay for a specified amount (` NUMBER `) of time.

	```bash
	sleep NUMBER
	```

* To ` sleep ` for 10 seconds.

	```terminal
	~$ sleep 10
	```

We will use ` sleep ` a simple process to demonstrate Linux process management.

## ` & `

*  A process is run in the background.

	```bash
	command &
	```

	```terminal
	~$ sleep 30 &
	[1] 5477
	```
 
* ` [1] ` denotes the command number that is pushed to background. Not to be confused with ` 5477 ` which is ` PID `

## ` coproc `

* A command to create ` coprocess ` (in executing shell or subshell).
* A two-way pipe is established between the executing shell and coprocess.
* The coprocess runs asynchronously and can listen to standard input and give back standard output on need.

* The syntax for a coprocess is:

	```bash
	coproc [NAME] command [redirections]
	```
 
	- This creates a coprocess named ` NAME `.
	- The ` command ` can be a simple command or a compound command.
	- If ` NAME ` is not given, default name is ` COPROC `.
	- ` NAME ` is a shell variable name. Avoid using reserved keywords for ` NAME `.

* The recommended form to use for a coprocess is using a grouped command in curly braces:

	```bash
	coproc [NAME] { command; }
	```
 
	- creates coprocess in a subshell.


* There are other forms:

	```bash
	coproc NAME compound-command
 	coproc simple-command
	```
 
	- ` NAME ` does not work with simple commands. Default name ` COPROC ` is used for simple commands.
	- ` compound-command ` can be a loop or a conditional or grouped command in parenthesis (creates subshell).
	- For simple commands coprocess is run in executing shell.

* Write to a specific coprocess stdin
  
	```bash
	echo "input" >&"${NAME[1]}"
	```

* Read from a specific coprocess stdout

	```bash
	read varname <&"${NAME[0]}"
	```

Examples:

* Create a coprocess running `bc` in a subshell.

	```terminal
	~$ coproc BC { bc --mathlib; };	# creates a coprocess
	[1] 3820
	~$ echo "22/7" >&"${BC[1]}" 	# write input to coprocess  
	~$ read output <&"${BC[0]}"	# read output from coprocess
	~$ echo $output	# echo the read output.
	3.14285714285714285714
	```
	
	- run ` ps --forest ` to see the process tree.
	
* Run command `sleep 10` as a coprocess.
	- NOTE: name can not be given for simple commands.

	```terminal
	~$ coproc sleep 10
	[1] 5499
	~$ 
	[1]+	Done				coproc COPROC sleep 10
	```

* Run a ` for ` loop as coprocess

	```bash
	coproc myloop for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done
	```

## ` fg `

* Bring a recent process running in the background to the foreground.

	```terminal
	~$ sleep 30 &
	[1]	5510
	~$ fg
	sleep 30
	```

## ` jobs `

* List the processes running in the background by the user.

	```terminal
	~$ coproc sleep 30
	[1] 5583
	~$ jobs
	[1]+  Running                 coproc COPROC sleep 30 &
	```


## ` top `

* Prints summary and live snapshots of processes running onto the screen.
* It is in decreasing order of CPU utilization ` %CPU `.
* Use ` q ` key or ` ^C ` to quit, ` ^Z ` to suspend it (move to background).  

	```bash
	top
	```

## ` kill `

* Kill a command using it's process id.

	```bash
	kill -9 <process id>
	```

	```terminal
	~$ coproc sleep 10
	[1] 5507
	~$ kill -9 5530
	~$
	[1]+	Killed				coproc COPROC sleep 10		
	```

## ` $! `

* It's an environment variable which stores the ` PID ` of the last process that is running/has run in the background.
* The value persits even if the process is finished.


# More on [Program Exit Codes](/Week-2/Lecture2.md#program-exit-codes)

*  If a command is run successfully then error code is ` 0 `.

	```bash
	~$ echo hello
	hello
	~$ echo $? 
	0
	```

* If a program/command has failed (like permission error) then error code is ` 1 `.

	```terminal
	/$ touch file1
	touch: cannot touch 'file1': Permission denied
	/$ echo $?
	1
	```

* If there is misuse of shell builtins, then error code is ` 2 `
	
	```terminal
	~$ ls -w
	ls: option requires an argument -- 'w'
	Try 'ls --help' for more information.
	~$ echo $?
	2
	~$ help -h
	bash: help: -h: invalid option
	help: usage: help [-dms] [pattern ...]
	~$ echo $?
	2
	```

* If the command can not be executed then error code is ` 126 `
	- ` file1 ` is not executable.

	```terminal
	~$ stat -c "%A" file1
	-rw-rw-r--
	~$ ./file1; echo $?
	bash: ./file1: Permission denied
	126
	```

* If the command is not found then the error code is ` 127 `

	```terminal
	~$ daet
	```

	- Very big output.
	
	```terminal
	~$ echo $?
	127
	```

* If the command is killed/inturrupted with ` ^C `, then the error code is `130`

	```terminal
	~$ sleep 30
	^C
	~$ echo $?
	130
	```

* If the process in some other shell is killed using ` kill -9 ` command, then the error code is ` 137 ` 

	- Terminal 1 : Iterative output of ` top ` command	

	```terminal
	~$ top
	```
 
	- Terminal 2 : Kill command ` top ` running in Terminal 1.


	```terminal
	~$ kill -9 2267
	~$
	```

	- Terminal 1 : Response

	```terminal
	Killed
	~$ echo $?
	137
	```

* Other exit codes
	- Returns exit code modulo 256 on exit code greater than 255.

	```terminal
	~$ bash -c "echo \$$; exit 3243;"
	6669
	~$ echo $?
	171
	```

Exit codes are useful when in a program you want to run a process based on exit code of other process.


# More on [Flags Set in Bash](/Week-2/Lecture2.md#flags-set-in-bash)

## ` $- `
* Special variable to print the flags set in bash.

	```terminal
	~$ echo $-
	himBHs
	```

* Let's run a command to check if there can be less number of flags.
	- ` bash ` : spawn a childshell
	- ` -c `  : consider first non-option argument as command
	- ` \ ` : escape character to stop early interpretation of ` $- `

	```terminal
	~$ bash -c "echo \$-"
	hBc
	```

* Check the pid of childshell and printing the forest view using ` ps `. 
	- Commands are separated with ` ; `

	```terminal
	~$ bash -c "echo \$$; echo \$-; ps --forest"
	```

## ` history ` command

* Stores commands run so far as history.
* ` !NUMBER ` (bang) is used to refer `NUMBER`th command. 
	- This is enabled when ` H ` flag is set.

	```bash
	history
	```

* To run ` echo $0 ` at position `2023` 

	```terminal
	~$ !2023
	echo $0
	bash
	```

## Brace Expansion

* Enabled using ` B ` flag.
* Expand ` {start..stop} ` into list of values between ` start ` and ` stop ` inclusive.

	```terminal
	~$ echo {a..d}
	a b c d
	~$ echo {5..1}
	5 4 3 2 1
	```

## Other Expansions

* A wildcard ` * ` matches all files.

	```terminal
	~$ echo *
	Desktop Documents Music Pictures Public snap Templates Videos
	~$ echo D*
	Desktop Documents Downloads
	```

# Multiple Commands on a Line

* Use semicolon ` ; ` to separate commands.
* Combining ` ls `, ` date ` and ` wc ` commands on same line.
* ` ; ` in the end is optional.

	```terminal
	~$ ls; date; wc -l /etc/profile;
	Desktop Documents Music Pictures Public snap Templates Videos
	Friday 23 December 2022 01:36:49 PM EET
	27 /etc/profile
	```
